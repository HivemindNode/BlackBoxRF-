# BlackBoxRF.py  
_A machine-learning RF intelligence tool._  

### What It Does:  
- **Listens and records sub-GHz signals for later analysis**  
- **Uses machine learning to detect patterns in RF transmissions**  
- **Identifies weaknesses in radio protocols automatically**  
- **Predicts future signals and suggests possible exploits**  

### Who Is It For?  
_"A signal that is understood is a signal that can be rewritten."_  

### How to Use:  
1. Connect **T-Embed CC1101** to your machine  
2. Start listening for RF signals:  
   ```bash
   python3 BlackBoxRF.py --listen
